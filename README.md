## Add a lib in electron main thread

Import your library in npm dependencies section (not **devDependencies**) with `npm install --save`. It will be loaded by electron during build phase and added to your final package. Then use your library by importing it in `main.ts` file. Quite simple, isn't it ?

## Browser mode

To execute the app in the browser with hot reload, run `npm run ng:serve:web`.
**Note that you can't use Electron or NodeJS native libraries in this case.** Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of electron/Native libraries is done.
